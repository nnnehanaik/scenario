# Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo

The Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo training is:
- Applicable for **Dev** centric as well as **Ops** centric profiles
- **Virtual**. A face to face version exists but has limited delivery capabilities
- **A story** of a Dev and Ops team, with identifiable characters:
  - **B**enjamin from **B**usiness
  - **P**atricia the **P**roduct Owner
  - **S**amuel the **S**crum Master
  - **A**dam the System **A**dministrator
  - **D**anny the **D**eveloper
  - **T**im the **T**ester
  - **S**arah from **S**ecurity
  - **H**arry the **H**acker
- **An application and its CD pipeline**: the team develops and operates a mobile web store (["The App"](https://github.com/devops-dojo/the-app)) together with its continuous delivery pipeline
- **A collection of modules**: videos / screencasts, which can be associated to a lab
- Modules can have multiple levels: 
  - Level 1: 10 minutes screencast summary
  - Level 2: 30 minutes screencast + lab
- **Labs** are based on the [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com) platform
- **Inner Source**: the modules and the labs are available and sourced from  [`github.dxc.com`](https://github.dxc.com/devops/yellow-belt). This is to enable collaboration for the content across the company, and maximize return on the investment.
- Built for DXC and with DXC's environment and tools in mind, but possibly can be adapted for specific customer environments.
